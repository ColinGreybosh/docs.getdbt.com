:::warning Deprecated functionality
In older versions of dbt, custom default values of flags (global configs) were set in `profiles.yml`. Starting in v1.8, these configs should be set in `dbt_project.yml` instead.
:::

For most global configurations, you can set "user profile" configurations in the `config:` block of `profiles.yml`. This style of configuration sets default values for all projects using this profile directoryâ€”usually, all projects running on your local machine.

<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yaml

config:
  <THIS-CONFIG>: true

```

</File>

The exception: Some global configurations are actually set in `dbt_project.yml`, instead of `profiles.yml`, because they control where dbt places logs and artifacts. Those file paths are always relative to the location of `dbt_project.yml`. For more details, see ["Log and target paths"](#log-and-target-paths) below.
